1. Requirements:
			Introduction:
				This is a simple HANGMAN GAME that we all had played in childhood.

				Player 1 will give a word as input and Player 2 will guess the word by giving an alphabet as input.
				If Player 2 guess it right then he/she will be the winner Player 2 gets only 5 chances to guess the word
				But this game has some constrains :
				Constrains 1 : all inputs has to be alphabets in small case
				
				Constrains 2: Player 2 can not give any string as input it has to be a single word with no space or any special character.
				
				Constrains 3: the word can not be more than 100 characters long



			Explanation:
				Player 1 picks a word from a word list
				Player 2 is allowed to guess the letters in the word, one at a time
				If a guessed letter is indeed in the word, its exact location in the word will be shown
				Otherwise Player 2 loses a guess
				Only a limited number of guesses is allowed - a correct guess is not counted
				He/She keeps guessing until:
				The complete word is shown  OR
				he/she runs out of guesses
				
				
				
			SWOT Analysis:

						2. It supports multiple platforms and can be deployed simultaneously.
						
			Weakness:	1. Player 2 gets only 5 chances to guess the word.
						2. It uses a CUI to provide interactivity.
						
			Opportunities:	1. It is a multiplayer game that can engage two people at one time.
							2. 
						
				
			4W's and 1'H:
				Who:
				USER : Anyone who wants to chill and is in a mood for some guessing game can utilize this.

				What:
				PRODUCT : It is a simple game of hangman. For those who donâ€™t know it, hangman is a word guessing game in which the player is told how many letters are in the word. The player must discover the word by guessing letters one at a time.
						Each correctly guessed letter is added to the word. On each wrong guess, a body part is added to a picture of a hanged man. Once the hanged man is complete, the player loses the game. 
				
				When: 
				ACTIVE : The problem with this is that Player 2 can not give any string as input it has to be a single word with no space or any special character.

				This will work only where the word is not more than 100 characters long.

				How:
				Player 1 picks a word from a word list and Player 2 is allowed to guess the letters in the word, one at a time.
				He/She keeps guessing until. The complete word is shown or he/she runs out of guesses.
